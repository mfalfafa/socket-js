### Basic TCP Client in Node JS ###

Using Node JS as TCP Client and Python as TCP Server.
TCP Client from Node JS will send data every second to TCP Server from Python. 
Transmitting and receiving proccess will use "ack" to make sure that the data is received by receiver (TCP Server).

Connection using LAN cable between Client and Server.
